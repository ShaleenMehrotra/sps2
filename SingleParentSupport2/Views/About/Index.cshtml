        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Single Parents Support was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to provide comprehensive support, resources, and community for single parents, especially those who have lost custody of their children.</p>
        <p>Our journey began when our founder, Jane Smith, experienced the challenges of single parenthood firsthand. After navigating the complex legal system, emotional turmoil, and practical difficulties of raising children alone, she recognized the need for a dedicated support system for single parents.</p>
        <p>What started as a small support group has grown into a comprehensive platform offering a range of services designed to address the unique challenges faced by single parents. Today, we are proud to serve thousands of single parents across the country, providing them with the tools, resources, and community they need to thrive.</p>
